This is an attempt to implement a sort of simplified bindings system for iOS tables.

It doesn't set out to attempt to recreate the full bindings system from MacOS X, just to simplify implementing common table tasks in iOS.

This is the third attempt I've made at this task - each one has been fairly different, and I've no particular confidence that I'll be any more satisfied with this one than I was with the other two (you can find bits of them in ECTouch at the moment, though I'll probably strip them out one day if this version works!).

This is work in progress, and I've not submitted the code here yet, so watch this space.
